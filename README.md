# STEMConf20-SustainabilityCS

Notes from the session "Embedding Sustainability in the Computer Science Curriculum" at the AdvanceHE STEM Conference 2020

## Discussion

-   reframing the issue - it is not about getting sustainability into CS, but rather showing that CS is going to be an integral part of any solution to sustainability problems
-   not all SDGs are going to be completely relevant
-   everyone has the same problem - 'how do I embed sustainability in X?' when realistically we need a holistic view across the whole institution
-   we can't deal with the whole sustainability agenda on a subject level but should be able to cope with it at an institutional level
-   cross-discipline projects would be a big benefit

## Potential Questions

-   do we need to embed sustainability in CS?
-   if so, is it possible to link all the SDGs to topics in the typical CS curriculum?
-   which are the harder SDGs to relate to CS?
-   what is the best approach to bring sustainability into CS?
-   are there any specific ideas for linking sustainability into CS?
